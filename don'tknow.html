  <p>Help! I don’t know what to study!</p>
  <h3>Don't worry, you're not the only one. Not having a set career plan, gives you options to explore different career paths...</h3>
  <p>There comes a time in university/college where you’ll have to decide what to specialise in. Problem is, not all of us have a clear idea of where to go after our studies. Here are a few tips to help you decide what will be best for you in the long run.</p>
  <h3>Tip: Improve your skills and knowledge by completing an online course through</h3>
  <h3>Chat with your family</h3>
  <p>Sometimes we’re too close to the problem to see a clear solution. Chat with your family and close friends about your skills and strengths. They might help you figure out what you’re good at and what you should pursue further. At the end of the day, remember that it’s completely your decision and you shouldn't feel pressured about studying what someone else thinks is best for you.</p>
  <h3>Speak to an academic advisor</h3>
  <p>Student advisors are there to help you find out what you’re good at and what you would possibly enjoy. Some may suggest that you start off with a general degree and then decide which of the subjects interest you most. It’s always worth picking their brain about a big decision that may impact your future. </p>
  <h3>Think about which industries and career paths interest you most</h3>
  <p>Try not to focus on one job type, but rather various careers that excite you within an industry. This will give you more room for career choices. For example, if you love fashion, but know that you can’t draw and sketch out designs, you might be a great writer who can inform readers about the latest trends. Instead of focusing on a particular job, delve into different facets of an industry that interests you. </p>
  <h3>You can achieve your dreams no matter how big they are</h3>
  <p>If you don’t believe in yourself no one else will. Remember that you can achieve all your dreams as long as you have a plan in place and you’re prepared to put in the hard work to accomplish your goals. Always study what you love, because if you don’t, you might just regret it later down the line.</p>
  <h3>Still not sure?</h3>
  <p>Draw up a list of pros and cons. Think of what matters to you in a job – is it security? Do you want to travel? Do you prefer working with people? Will money make you happiest? Think of all these things and if you’re still uncertain about what you’d like to do, go for general courses that will expose you to many different fields and then later decide what’s best for you.  </p>
  <p>Remember that no matter what you choose to study, you don't have to stick with the same career path for the rest of your life. Most times, starting off in one job will open opportunities in other places.</p>
